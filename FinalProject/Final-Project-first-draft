I completed the connections between viewcontrollers and tableView. Also, the text in the viewController can show up on the tableView.
I did partily function is that I plan to show the total money the person left in the account which will appear at the tableView.
I did not complete the storage. If I close the app and open it, the data is not be saved.
My question is that how to store the data.I followed the data that posted on the lecture10, but it did not work.
